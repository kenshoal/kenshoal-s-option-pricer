# kenshoal's option pricer

This is a simple project which does not leverage on any frameworks. 

It uses bootstrap for CSS and is a website which I created to apply what I learned in Akuna Capital's Option 101. 

One limitation would be the API which I used that only allows for historical IV as the others require a paid subscription. 

I plan to add in option strategies and more documentation of what I learn in the future.
