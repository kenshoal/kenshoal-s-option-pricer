          <strong>Delta:</strong> Delta typically measures the responsiveness of
          the option price with a $1 change in the underlying price. One can
          think of delta in 3 ways.

          <li>
            How responsive the option price is with regard to a change in the
            underlying price.

          Description: Take for example a call option with δ = 0.5, its price
          will increase by $0.50 with every $1 increase in the underlying price.
          <br />
          On the other hand, a put option with δ = -0.4 signifies that its price
          will increase by $0.40 with every $1 decrease in the underlying price.

        <p id="gamma">
          <strong>Gamma:</strong> Gamma typically measures the rate of change of
          an option's delta for a $1 move in the underlying asset's price. If an
          option has high gamma,it means that its delta will change drastically
          with a small change in price, potentially leading to it being more
          sensitive to price changes.
          <br />
          <br />
          Gamma is highest when the option is at-the-money, and lowest for
          options which are deep in- or out-the-money.
